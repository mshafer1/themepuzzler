# yaml allows for comments!

# to add pages to the site, add an entry below
#- title: {title of the page (no spaces, case sensitive)}
#  pieces:
#  - piece1.mp3
#  - piece2.mp3
# ...
#  reviewed: false
#  
# a page that has a false value for reviewed will be created, but not included in the menu, allow for a sanity check first.
# At this time, only mp3 file formats are supported by the site.
# The piece list needs to be in the order that is considered correct.

# all pieces need to be files folder. Can be nested, but again no spaces in the paths and the case sensitive (and use forware / slashes)
